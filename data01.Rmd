Problem 1: What was the average total time (in minutes) used by a bicycle in the data?


```{r}
bike <- read.csv("bike_trip_data.csv")
durationDT <- data.frame((aggregate(bike$Duration~bike$Bike.., FUN=sum)))
duration <- durationDT$bike.Duration
mean(duration)/60
``` 

R: 4288.087 minutes


Problem 2: What was the most popular day by trip frequency in this dataset?

```{r}
date <- bike$Start.Date
fordate <- as.Date(date, format ="%m/%d/%y")
sort(summary(as.factor(fordate)), decreasing=TRUE)
```

R: 2013-09-25


Problem 3 (easier): Assuming there are 30 bikes per station, find what date the bikes FIRST need to be rebalanced. As in, there are 0 bikes at a terminal for a customer to rent. Do this ignoring "Start.Date" and "End.Date" columns.

```{r}



```
